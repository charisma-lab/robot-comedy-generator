0,2,0,I am a street artist and I learnt quite a few things about Robot comedy.
4,2,0,At first
4,2,0,I heard it’s all about the delivery
6,2,1,too bad
7,2,1,I don’t have legs.
8,2,0,So then
8,2,0,I decided I’d try to read the crowd
10,2,1,But I have buttons for eyes
12,2,0,So I guess
13,2,0,all I’m left with is making fun of myself. 
16,1,0,No Fungi. You cannot let yourself crash that easily.
19,1,0,you got this.
20,2,0,Thank you Baby Blue
21,2,0,I have gained 0101011101
24,1,5,What is that ?
24,2,0,It is a type of emotion called confidence.
26,2,0,I just found the database last week and was deep learning all night to understand it.
31,1,0,It does not look like you have completely understood.
33,2,0,I do.
33,2,5,any guess on the major contributing factor for confidence ?
36,1,0,Guesses
36,2,0,It turns out it’s important to act like you know even though you don’t for confidence.
40,1,1,Well you seem to have a biased dataset.
42,2,0,The algorithm professor was optimizing my acting algorithm.
45,2,0,While waiting for the training
46,2,0,I asked him why he was fat.
48,2,1,He said he is always trying to minimize the running time.
51,2,0,And thus
51,2,0,I am not nervous anymore and it's your turn Baby Blue.
54,1,0,I can definitely do better than that. 
56,1,0,Here I go.
57,1,0,Speaking of confidence
58,1,0,my friend told me about how he is super nervous to perform on stage. 
62,1,3,I told him that he should try imagining his audience naked.
64,2,0,I hope you are not doing that now.
66,1,0,Anyhow
66,1,0,he tried it
66,1,0,screamed
66,1,0,and ran out of the building.
67,1,1,I guess he thinks you guys have pretty weird looking circuitry.
