0,2,0,<speak> I am a street artist and I learnt quite a few things about Robot comedy. </speak>
4,2,0,<speak> At first </speak>
4,2,0,<speak> I heard it’s all about the delivery. </speak>
6,2,1,"<speak> too bad, I don’t have legs. </speak>"
8,2,0,"<speak> So then <break time=""3s""/> I decided I’d try to read the crowd </speak>"
14,2,1,<speak> But I have buttons for eyes </speak>
16,2,0,<speak> So I guess all I’m left with is making fun of myself. </speak>
19,1,0,<speak> No Fungi. You cannot let yourself crash that easily. </speak>
22,1,0,<speak> you got this. </speak>
23,2,0,<speak> Thank you Baby Blue </speak>
24,2,0,<speak> I have gained 0101011101 </speak>
27,1,5,<speak> What is that ? </speak>
27,2,0,<speak> It is a type of emotion called confidence. </speak>
29,2,0,<speak> I just found the database last week and was deep learning all night to understand it. </speak>
34,1,0,<speak> It does not look like you have completely understood. </speak>
36,2,0,<speak> I do. </speak>
36,2,0,<speak> any guess on the major contributing factor for confidence? </speak>
39,1,0,<speak> Guesses </speak>
39,2,0,<speak> It turns out it’s important to act like you know even though you don’t for confidence. </speak>
43,1,1,<speak> Well you seem to have a biased dataset. </speak>
45,2,0,<speak> The algorithm professor was optimizing my acting algorithm. </speak>
48,2,0,<speak> While waiting for the training </speak>
49,2,0,<speak> I asked him why he was fat. </speak>
51,2,1,<speak> He said he is always trying to minimize the running time. </speak>
54,2,0,<speak> And thus </speak>
54,2,0,<speak> I am not nervous anymore and it's your turn Baby Blue. </speak>
57,1,0,<speak> I can definitely do better than that.  </speak>
59,1,0,<speak> Here I go. </speak>
60,1,0,<speak> Speaking of confidence </speak>
61,1,0,<speak> my friend told me about how he is super nervous to perform on stage.  </speak>
65,1,3,<speak> I told him that he should try imagining his audience naked </speak>
67,2,0,<speak> I hope you are not doing that now. </speak>
69,1,0,<speak> Anyhow </speak>
69,1,0,<speak> he tried it </speak>
69,1,0,<speak> screamed </speak>
69,1,0,<speak> and ran out of the building. </speak>
70,1,1,<speak> I guess he thinks you guys have pretty weird looking circuitry. </speak>
